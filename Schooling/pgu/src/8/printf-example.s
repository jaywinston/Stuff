 #PURPOSE:  This program is to demonstrate how to call printf
 #

  .section .data

 #This string is called the format string.  It's the first
 #parameter, and printf uses it to find out how many parameters
 #it was given, and what kind they are.
 firststring:
  .ascii "Hello! %s is a %s who loves the number %d\n\0"
 name:
  .ascii "Jonathan\0"
 personstring:
  .ascii "person\0"
 #This could also have been an .equ, but we decided to give it
 #a real memory location just for kicks
 numberloved:
  .long 3

  .section .text
  .globl _start
 _start:
  #note that the parameters are passed in the
  #reverse order that they are listed in the
  #function's prototype.
  pushl numberloved     #This is the %d
  pushl $personstring   #This is the second %s
  pushl $name           #This is the first %s
  pushl $firststring    #This is the format string
                        #in the prototype
  call  printf

  pushl $0
  call  exit
