Stubs and drivers are for testing the program before it is usable.  Stubs are
functions that just return a usable value without any processing.  They are
used in place functions that are not developed yet but are called by the
function being developed now.  Drivers are functions that test funtions being
developed.  They load the function, supply it with data and check the results.
