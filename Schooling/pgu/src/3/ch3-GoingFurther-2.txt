    Of the methods, a special number, an ending address, or a length count,
which to use to find the end of list could depend on the context.  If the list
is completely arbitrary, than a special number could be used assuming the list
is formed that way.  If the list starts at an unknown address but the ending
address is known, than the ending address could be used.  If the length of the
list is known, than the length count could be the best as it saves room in
memory by not using the last item in the list to mark the end.
    If the list were sorted, the ending address or length count would
facilitate going straight to largest number without the loop (assuming the list
is sorted in ascending order, otherwise the first item would be the largest).
As such, the ending address would need fewer instructions.
