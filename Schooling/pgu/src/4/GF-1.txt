I think it balances out.  The larger set would make the system larger and
more vulnerable to bugs but the applications could be smaller and more robust
(as robust as the system).  The smaller set could make a smaller and more
robust system but the applications would be larger and more prone to bugs.
Perhaps it's a decision based on available resources.
