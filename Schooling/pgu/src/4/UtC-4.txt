The problems that would arise without a standard calling convention could
be essentially one, increased likelyhood of human error.  Were every function
to have its own calling convention, such would become an additional part of its
interface.  And the added parameter of its use would add another opportunity
for error.  The calling convention seems especially prone to error in that the
method of calling a function is a very low-level idea, usually given to the
system.  In the case of assembly language, the convention relieves some of that
burden from the programmer.  So leaving the programmer to remember a different
convention for every function could easily be overwhelming and thus prone to
error.  The results could be severe, from unexpected output to data loss to
system corruption.
