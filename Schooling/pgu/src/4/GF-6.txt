power.s test cases:
    The text precludes some of these tests but...

    - decimal numbers
    - negative numbers
    - negative decimal numbers
    - zero

    all cases in either and both parameters in all combinations

    Within the constraints of the text...

    - all powers are positive integers of varying value
    - bases of:
        first positive, second positive
        first positive, second negative
        first negative, second positive
        first negative, second negative
