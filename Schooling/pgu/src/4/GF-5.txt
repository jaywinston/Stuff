A calling convention without using the stack could be to place arguments in the
registers starting from %eax and moving sequentially upwards in the alphabet.
The return value would be put in %eax.
Limitations would be that the number of arguments is limited to number of
available registers.

Another calling convention could be to create a global array that would hold
all of the arguments.  The return value would be put in the first index of the
array.  Limitations would be that the code might be a bit hard to read.  And
any recursion, even indirectly, would overwrite the array so the function would
need to store the values of the array, probably on the stack.  So that might be
considered using the stack.
