This is an interactive turtle graphics console.  It is my chapter 9 project for
the nand2tetris course.
https://www.nand2tetris.org/copy-of-talks#:~:text=Turtle%20Graphics%20Console
It has some basic list processing, conditionals, loops, and function
definitions as statements and expressions.  It is dynamically scoped and
garbage collected.

In general, expressions are space delimited.  Blocks, lists and strings
allow embedded spaces, though format expressions do not.  An expression not
used in a command or assignment is echoed to the console.

Blocks are a list of zero or more command lines enclosed by '{' and '}'.
They may be nested and span multiple lines.

Lists are a list of zero or more expressions enclosed by '[' and ']'.
They also may be nested and span multiple lines.

Strings are a sequence of any printable characters recognized by the Hack
platform, except for '"' and '\', enclosed by '"' and '"'.  They may not be
nested nor span multiple lines.  There are some escape sequences described
below in the description of format expressions.

Arithmetic expressions mostly follow standard precedence rules. Unary operators
bind tightest of anything, bit-wise logic binds looser than anything, and
comparison operators follow.  Besides that, rules are standard.  Parentheses
are honored.
Operators are:
 unary:
  + absolute value
  - arithmetic negation
  ~ bit-wise negation
 binary:
  & bit-wise and
  | bit-wise or
  == equal
  != not equal
  >= greater than or equal
  <= less than or equal
  > greater than
  < less than
  * multiplication
  / division
  % modulo
  + addition
  - subtraction

Format expressions are <format string> ',' <argument> [',' <argument> ...]
So it looks like:

"%D %S\N",8,"BANG!"

which resolves to:

8 BANG!


Format directives are a percent ('%') character followed by a specifier.
Specifiers are 'S' for string, 'D' for integers and '%' for literal '%'.
Any other character is an error.  Three escape sequences, 'N' for newline,
'"' for double quote character, and '\' for reverse solidus character are
recognized and escaped by a backslash ('\') character.  Any other character
resolves to itself.

Blocks and functions return their last executed line.

Lists are zero-indexed as follows:

<list> '.' <index>

so [1 2 3].1 resolves to 2.  Indexes can be any expression that resolves
to an integer.

Functions are a binding of one command line to an expression.  They can be
anonymous.  As they are one command line, multiple lines must wrapped in
a block.  They can be passed as arguments.  To capture a function's return
value, it must be called as the last line of a block e.g.

N={F}

or

FORWARD {
  TURNLEFT 180
  F
}

Variables are assigned as <ref> '=' <expr> e.g. N=90.  Though assignment
is not an expression, white space is not allowed.

The commands are:

        APPEND <list> <expression>
            append expression to list; returns null;

        APPLY <list> <function>
            apply function in place to the elements of list; returns null;

        CLEARLIST <list>
            clear list of elements; returns null

        COPY <list> [<integer> <integer>]
            returns a copy of list; if integers are given return a copy
            of list from indices integer to integer, inclusive

        EXTEND <list> <list>
            extend list with list; returns null;

        LENGTH <list|string>
            returns length of list or string

        CLEAR
            clear the canvas and console, reset the turtle; returns null

        DIR
            returns the turtle's direction

        FORWARD <integer>
            negative integer is an error

        PENDOWN

        PENUP

        POSX
            returns the turtle's horizontal coordinate

        POSY
            returns the turtle's vertical coordinate

        (The origin is at the bottom-left corner.)

        TURNLEFT <integer>

        TURNRIGHT <integer>

        FUNCTION [<name>] <cmdlin>
            interpret cmdlin.  If name is defined, bind interpretation to it,
            otherwise return interpretation.

        HELP
            not so helpful

        IF <condition> <cmdlin> [ELSE <cmdlin>]

        PRINT <string>
            print string on the canvas at the turtle's position; returns null

        REPEAT [IF] {<expression>|<list> <name>} <cmdlin>
            repeat cmdlin expression times.  If IF is provided, repeat while
            expression (or it's length if it has one) does not resolve to zero.
            Otherwise if expression is a list, repeat for every element in it
            with element assigned to name.  Does not overwrite element.

BUGS
    - Anonymous functions cannot start with a name-expression.
    - The last term of a parenthesized arithmetic expression cannot be
      an index-expression whose index expression is a parenthesized
      arithmetic expression.
    (A workaround for both is to wrap the problem-expression in a block.)
    - Wrapping a commaed format string in a block confuses the formatter.
      A workaround is to leave a space between the comma and the right bracket.
