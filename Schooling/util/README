I included these scripts in this repository to illustrate my work environment.
They were first written for one tutorial.  When I saw that my work flow was the
same for the next tutorial, I rewrote them to work for any tutorial.  Then I
realized that they are an example of my work.  So I documented them and
included them in this repository.

There are adjustments to the environment.  CWD is an environment variable and
PATH is prepended with this directory.  To remind me of this, I prepend PS1
with the name of the tutorial in parentheses (like Python's venv).  Any other
changes are defined in Schooling/.bashrc.  And there is a function there named
deactivate that cleans up the environment as best it can.

The evironment is initialized by a function in $HOME/.bashrc:

    function learn {
        if check=$(~/Github/Stuff/Schooling/util/rc_learn $*) ; then
            BASEDIR=~/Github/Stuff/Schooling TUTORIAL=$check \
                source ~/Github/Stuff/Schooling/.bashrc
            cd $CWD
            getopts q q || (okular $(sed -n '4p' .config) &) &>/dev/null
            unset q
        else
            echo "learn: err: '$check'"
        fi
    }

Each tutorial directory has a '.config' file.  It's format is the current
chapter on the first line and a space-delimited list of file names on the
second line.  It is populated automatically.  Though it needs to be manually
created.

todo: explain the last two lines of .config format
